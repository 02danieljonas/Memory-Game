## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I asked my friend Smyvens and my sister to check out my website and asked for ways they thought I could improve it.
www.w3schools.com, https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/how+to+append+empty+array+in+javascript, https://pietschsoft.com/post/2015/09/05/javascript-basics-how-to-create-a-dictionary-with-keyvalue-pairs, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15189857/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-empty-a-plain-object-in-javascript, https://dev.to/sanchithasr/7-ways-to-convert-a-string-to-number-in-javascript-4l, https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/70-3-ways-to-clone-objects/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUdc2szWz8Q, https://www.thoughtco.com/create-a-shorter-if-statement-in-javascript-2037428#:~:text=variable%20name%20contains.-,A%20Shorter%20IF%20Statement,are%20optional%20for%20single%20statements)., https://cssgradient.io/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Sliders, settings the value, taking in the values, making sure everything matches, making sure things don't break, infinity. The IDE glitch, the little things VSCode does is so awesome, I would have changed to using VSCode and a liveserver, but i only realized how great VSCode is after using glitch. I was thinking of adding a way to indicate which number to press for eaching button, another hard part of making the gifs, every time I go to record it I notice a new mistake and have to go and fix it. The problem I have the most is probably what ever problem happened the most recent, bad memory :(, as I might have to say the readme, it has gotten me to look over all my feature and made me realize ever error that was in the code forcing me to stop recording and fix it, also getting gifs to work in readme was hard

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
how to keep track of all those features
like I have 500lines of ccode and I don't think I could keep track of all 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would make my code more readable. I would change out cookies for localstorage, make the buttons a class so I allow the user to create more buttons, connect to a dynamoDB to allow highscores, having an easy, medium, hard option.
